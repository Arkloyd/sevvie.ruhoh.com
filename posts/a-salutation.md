This goes out to the soldiers, the warriors, the hard-grind workers who fight
every day for their individual rights in the silent protest of visible pain; to
the veterans and invisible millions destroying themselves every day to have a
better life here in the First World. To those who couldn't walk to be at the
rallies and make joyful noise and to those who couldn't purchase a bag and
share in intoxicated four-twenty joys;

To those in hospitals begging for clarity above the dragging vulgarity of
opium's dexterity and to those who hide in alcoves and windows and hostels to
take part in medication that spreads their wings free;

To the rebels of cause who cry out without pause to the invasive claws of their
government as it gnaws at the very principles of culture, demanding a voice and
liberties;

To the artists, starving, by moon's dim lighting, painting their souls for us
to see:

I salute you.
