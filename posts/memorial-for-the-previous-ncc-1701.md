description: A few days after the attackers took me apart.

There's no outline or plan for this blog post; after such an adventure of a
day, I felt it necessary to write freely.

If you had asked me last night, I would have agreed that the world was to end
quite soon. Things seemed quite bleak, twelve hours after the attacks began,
and I was counting what was left rather than what was lost. I don't know for
certain, but I have my speculations and ideas as to what happened.

A year ago, when everything went from sour to rotting, I lost control of a few
of my domain names. Through a mixture of trust and need to maintain the
brand-names I had been building around myself, I had moved to their registrar,
their DNS servers; I was an idiot but we all learn somehow. Perhaps it was the
impending anniversary of my arrest. Maybe the domain was nearing its expiration
and one last hurrah was desired. Either way, through manipulation of the Google
Apps account associated with this e-mail address, she was able to reset
passwords, one by one. Either my primary e-mail address, or my Facebook account
were the first taken territories in this... I can't keep calling it an attack.
Through a security hole very difficult to explain but nonetheless large enough
to pass a freight train through, this person was able to compromise every one
of my current accounts.

If trophies or information were taken, I highly doubt the assailant even knows
what they have. They could have nothing; I have led such a confusing mess of a
life regarding accounts with Google, Twitter, Facebook, Yahoo and every other
account services holder out there; it might just be static with large gaps.
There was timing to it all, though; all the way up to the point in which each
site I had spent so much time putting together was summarily deleted and
removed from the current internet. In memorandum, I inscribe their names here.

* [sevvie.cc][1]
* [sevvie.co][2]
* [corvina.org][3]
* [nanabox.net][4]

* [facebook.com/sevvielove][5]
* [sevvielove's Google+][6]

Each of these sites has been taken, all its content, deleted. I don't blame the
attacker. The attacker acted out of a combination of self-righteousness and
hate. I should have protected my data better, had I wished to share it with the
world. Will I be struck again? Am I truly secure? I don't know. I do know this,
though; no matter how many times what I build is destroyed, I will rebuild it,
and I will build it better.

Edit: I had previously used a slightly derogatory phrase to describe the
attacker; I have reworded it to be more in line with what I think without
resorting to ad-hominem.
