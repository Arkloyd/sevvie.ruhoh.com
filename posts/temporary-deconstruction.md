I'm taking a brief interlude off my Gracious Benefactor's servers, to
re-evaluate my writing and publishing online, and how I accomplish it. It
will take me time to really get things going, and I'd rather not dirty up
the production environment (any more than I have) while I work out these
curious little puzzles.

I'll be slowly moving posts from my old blog at [blog.sevvie.net][1] to
here; if nothing else, it will get them into Markdown so I don't feel so
distant and disconnected from them on a road trip, or other period of time
offline. In addition, I'll be implementing my design(s) using this site,
with the aid of a running side-project; [App.net Facades][2]. It's just a
blog, now, and for that reason alone I don't like it. But sometimes, you
deal with what you don't like, to get or make what you do like.

I haven't been writing much, recently. I've had a lot to say, but it seems
like far more to do. But that's going to change, slightly.

A toast, to the future.
