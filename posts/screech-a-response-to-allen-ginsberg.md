I wish I had your eyes, Alan, to see where my generation has been destroyed, in
their own starving, hysterical nakedness; no longer are the streets negro but
in the melting pot, unfixed;

angel-headed hipsters burning for the ancient heavenly connection to the starry
dynamo in the now digitized and computerized night; angel-headed hipsters...

who now, without the understandings of poverty or familiarity with tattering, hollow-eyed and damning the smoking from the supernatural and intimidating darknesses below, knowing nothing about cold-water flats, more interested in auto-tune than jazz,  
who by baring their brains to Heaven, seeked and saw nothing at all; no El and no Mohammed, no angels that staggered beneath star-light and satellite,  
who passed through the universities with both radiant and unfinding eyes hallucinating Doctor Who and Bronies without awareness of the wars of the scholars,  
who skimmed on passing grades without even the hint of failure marking their academic career, never publishing an out of line word or breaking a rule with obscenity or violence or even a small painting on their wall,  
who begged for understanding and employment and purpose but only found dullness and silence in to the whir of their laptop's cry, burning with data and electricity unseen;  
They aren't busted in Los Angeles or New York, their crimes of foolishness and unguided ennui prevent them from ever finding more than a slap on the wrist buying marijuana in Vancouver;  
whose fire came from mass entertainment and every form of shelter and protection; there is no turpentine to drink and no death to observe, pain and purgatory are distant from the mind under the influences;  
with drugs like Prozac and Paxil and Wellbutrin replacing the minds, bodies and souls of those trapped in true walking nightmares, unable to find nearly enough cannabis or alcohol to silence the screaming, demanding, heartless voices,  
Ritalin and backyards of brick conceal and hide cemetaries from dawn, not even our soldiers get their due reverie while those drunk on wine in the streetways and on the balconies beneath high rooftops, tucked into the overhang of storefronts and hiding in the overpopulated mass transit vehicles no longer amazed with their views of city light and neon; the brain is drained of all brilliance in the drear light of iPhones.

who chained themselves to cellular phones to ride down the endless streams limited only by battery life and holy Bars of signal, on vicodin and herbal supplements until the vibration and noise and children forced them from the mass transit and their cars, bleaked and thumb-wracked and battered bleak of brain in the both boring and misunderstood glares of Work,  
who sank all night by the exotic fish-tanks and plasma lights of Sunset Blvd and Fifth Avenue floated out and sat through the stale Pabst Blue Ribbon and endless microbrew afternoon in the now nameless and tasteless sports bars, listening to the crack of bones on the mercury and noble gas seventy-two-inch displays,  
Who typed continuously, if it could be called typing, from home to work to JFK to Heathrow to hotel, their aircraft and cabs equipped now with WiFi,  
a lost battalion of conversationalists and direct interactors, skipping down the steps and ignoring everything but to what they've subscribed in RSS and Twitter, watching their very own Empire and Golden states from a place far away yet right at their fingertips,  
yakkityyakking, screaming, vomiting, whispering facts and memories and misinformation and slander and anecdotes and eyeball kicks and need to go to the hospital and do away entirely with wars,  
whose intellects disgorged in total recall and Social Network searches for endless days and nights with screen-illuminated eyes, meat for the Scientology Centers cast on the pavement;  
who vanished into nowhere, Zen, the stream of Trending Topics on Twitter in New Jersey, leaving a trail of ambiguous Instagrams of the world outside a taxi window,  
suffering sweats from social anxiety and grinding their teeth to herbivoric flats with migraines and allergies of smoke and radio signals, under a change in medications in Austin and Minneapolis' unrestored motel rooms,  
Who wandered around all night in the streets rattled by electrically-run and leashed bus cables overhead, wondering where to go, and went, leaving all hearts broken,  
who lit joints and spliffs in alcoves, alcoves, alcoves, racketing through global warming and shearing rains toward lonesome abandoned buildings in the Baby Boomer night,  
who studied the Apple and Steve Jobs' reality distortion field and Krav Maga because the universe was so silent until the feet of these teachers came via YouTube to the soulless farmlands of Kansas,  
who loned it through the streets of Idaho and Portland and Tacoma and Fort Worth seeking visionary American start-ups who were visionary American start-ups,  
who only thought they were mad when San Francisco gleamed supernatural cannabanoids and ecstasy,  
who jumped into limousines with the Venture Capitalists from Silicon Valley on the impulse of winter midnight streetlight smalltown rain,  
who lounged lonely through Newark, seeking electronica or sex or soup, and followed by the iron-fisted Guidos to converse about Whatevah and That Chick, an impossible struggle for more, so you took plane to Europe, or India,  
who disappeared into the Pubs and violent Casinos of Mexico City leaving behind nothing but the shirts and bras worn last night and the stain and stench of liquors and ash of collateral damage left in the hotel rooms of Tijuana,  
who reappeared on the West Coast investigating the Private Military and Security Firms with beards and suits and heavy pacifist eyes accented by powerful Harvard words, sexy in their dark skin passing out business cards,  
who burned cigarette holes in their arms and legs not only in protest of the narcotic tobacco haze of Capitalism but of the grand and incomprehensible landscape of nothing before them.

Who believed in Nothing so greatly to distribute only vain quips across Twitter in Union Station, yawning and undressing others with their eyes while the echoes of Capitalism vibrated the walls and subterrania into wails, wailings of the Earth in London and Manhattan, in Vancouver and they wailed in San Francisco as well;  
who broke down crying in utter frustration and confusion, naked in the face of true wisdoms, trembling before the machinations of a world built for someone else,  
who stole the souls of detectives with cameras built into phones, shrieking with delight at what can be posted to Facebook, retreating in terror to the safety of internet anonymity despite having committed no crimes, but their own wild cooking pederasty and intoxication,  
who, with no practice or experience of cries of heart, no longer howl but screech on their knees before the altar of their computer desks, obsessed with genitals but incapable of manuscripting,  
who let themselves be fucked in the ass by saintly corporations, and screamed with joy,  
who looked and let be shown their nakedness to the new media's seraphim, the Reddits, caresses of fished compliments in the Internet's love,  
who balled in the mornings and evenings in over and undersized apartments, in the grass of open parks and alcoves of Downtown's fear of rain, scattering their semen to whatever may cross their laptop's screen,  
who giggled endlessly only finding themselves at that ageless sobbing, deep in the godawful loneliness of now empty Turkish Baths; no blond and naked angel walks in but rather stabs with words called spam,  
who required no change to the master's words:  
who lost their loveboys to the three old shrews of fate and the one old shrew of the heterosexual dollar, the one eyed shrew that winks out of the womb and the one eyed shrew that does nothing but sit on her ass and snip the intellectual golden threads of the craftsman's loom,  
who copulated ecstatic and insatiate and fell off the bed, and continued along the floor and down the hall and ended up fainting on the wall with with a vision of ultimate cunt and come eluding the last gyzym of consciousness,  
who sweetened the snatches of a million girls trembling into the sunset, and were red eyed in the morning but prepared to sweeten the snatch of the sunrise, flashing buttocks under barns and naked in the lake, in bathroom mirrors and under the gaze of the webcam, with the help of friends and spread to every corner of the universe,  
who went to explore their sexuality in San Francisco and Portland in myriad stolen nights and borrowed parent's cars; A.G., secret hero of these poems, angel defying gender in cocksmanship and endless femininity, Asclepius of Sacramento -- praise not only to her sexual virility and flexibility but to conversations and unstoppable fights to shape a world both free and hers, understood & accepted & needed, in run-down apartments coated with the stain of tobacco smoke and guest houses, in court houses and over horrific medical emergencies,  
who faded out in vast sordid movies, were shifted in dreams, woke on a sudden yet stoned Portland, and picked themselves out of the gaps and absences of life with loving Honne and Tatamae and horrors of Small Town digital dreams, now stumbling into grocery stores for work.
