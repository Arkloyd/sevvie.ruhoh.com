For months, now, I have spent much of my time thinking on a subject that seems
like it should come naturally to me; "Why do I want to do these things I want
to do? How does that relate to how I do these things?" My methodologies for
answering such questions hasn't been the best, I'll admit; googling and watching
videos on TED.com and YouTube, after nine months of meditation and peace in
self-exploration that could only be described as Descartean... But it's the same
research and exploration, that fills me with this drive, this drive to express,
and express well. I want to write software, and I want to design beautiful and
sensible and interoperable platforms for information, because I believe in the
gathering, curating, and sharing of information.

## Introduction

I love everyone; in fact, I believe in loving everyone. I believe in loving
everyone because despite any difference one could find between person A, and
person B, both A and B are humans, and you, the observer, are human as well.
We share a species; for twenty-thousand years we have cultivated not only
language and civilization, but concepts so beautifully abstract: mathematics
and industry, physics, astronomy, computers and the internet, and diplomacy,
to name just a few. Through co-operation, and conflict, interaction and quiet
observation, through every human behaviour, we have arrived, here, together.

## Good artists borrow and great artists steal, but...

Some of us have arrived, though, with a privilege that others do not have; it
is a simple matter of access to understandable information. It's not the first
time the species has seen this problem; there has always been sensitivity to
information of one type or another, as far back as we have documentation to
study. What we do have, in this age, that wasn't nearly as feasible in previous
ages, is the rapid collection, curation, translation, and parallel digital and
print distribution, aided by internet communication and modern shipping systems.

It is said, in regards to Internet and citizen participation in the public
discourse, that 90% of people merely observe, 9% curate or update or discuss
the matter at hand, and 1% create the original content, and keep the discourse
moving through activity and encouragement. Doing any of the above is easier than
ever for those of us with Internet access; Wikipedia and Git, blogs and Twitter
and Facebook and App.net are the beginnings of globally-accessible information.
Multiple authors and contributors can discuss and debate the writing of an
article to later be published on a website, on GitHub, and nigh-immediately
make their changes and show them to be compared. With creativity and the intent,
you can create specific search terms for Twitter, and plug them into IFTTT.com
to mail you batches of tweets relating to the story you wish you curate into
shape, and you can give your resulting product the sternest of reviews --
Link from Wikipedia to your digital publication; you could even find people to
assist in translating your link so that the link can be put on all the
translations of the page in Wikipedia... but you can't share this information
where it is, arguably, needed most.

I believe that all life is art. I believe that good artists borrow, that great
artists steal, and that the best artists remix and collaborate. I want to do
all of the above, and then some, perhaps even be the ouroboros that urges
information to continue flowing: a consumer that pushes forward to create; a
creator that attends to the needs of curation; a curator who seeks out new and
interesting consumption and discourse.  Then, then I wish to make this
information to the places I suspect it would be of best use; blueprints of
basic and advanced architecture and mechanics availed to Africa and Southwest
Asia, along with detailed information about the requisite supplies, tools and
techniques used, and the concerns and outright warnings associated with the
end-result and everything between here, and there.

This isn't because I think any one of us has done it right. It would be
premature of me, to declare what is still actively happening with such a
polarizing concept such as "right" or "wrong". It is generally-accepted by what
we have declared as the First-World, right now, however; we accept things as
such because of our thoughts, and our histories and ancestries. Many of these
concepts can be found, completely independent of your own upbringing, all
around the world; it was by their own thoughts, histories and ancestries, that
they were able to reach their own conclusions, that matched ours.  It is
because we, as a species, are capable of making discoveries under the most
amazing of circumstances, and oftentimes, without any awareness of the other
group of people working on the exact same idea.

## Fluxions and Differentials...

In the year 1699, there was a great debate regarding the future of a rather
important and increasingly-accepted idea: did Gottfried Liebnitz discover calculus,
completely independently of Isaac Newton? More than two decades of debate and
discourse, mostly documented through the personal letters sent by each party
to third-parties, went into this discussion. Their ideas were almost identical;
the differences came down to the means through which they made their discoveries
and conclusions, and the definition of relationships in infinitesimal calculus:
Liebnitz designated the more familiar notation and term, 'differential', while
Newton provided the 'dot-notation', and called his infinitesimal units, 'fluxions'.
Liebnitz started with integration and made his way toward differentiation, while
Newton started with differentiation and made his way toward integration.

He must have copied it, he must have seen Newton's documents before 1675; this
was the most common detracting argument toward Liebnitz in his defense of his
calculus. L'Hopital, whose works are amongst those that construct modern calculus,
accounted for both parties in his works describing infinitesimal calculus, and
to this day we use most of Newton's Calculus, with Liebnitz' notation for
'differentials'.

## ... and the Kerala School of Astronomy and Mathematics

But neither of them, nor H'opital, were first.

In the now state of Kerala, India, with its oceans and mountains so convenient,
brilliant mathematicians and astronomers gathered to solve the great
astronomical problems of their day, between the 14th and 16th centuries AD.
Amongst their greatest discoveries is series-expansion for trigonometric functions,
a set of theories that seemed impossible to solve without calculus, in Europe.

Two centuries before Liebnitz and Newton's famed debate over the inventor of
calculus, Indian mathematicians in the state of Kerala, India, made discoveries
based on the very ideas of calculus, and without any formal descriptions of
integration, or differentiation. It is also documented in the earliest English
translations of the works, that they used the 'intuitive' concept of a limit,
also centuries before their definition by L'Hopital.

## The Loom, and the Computer

Once things are discovered, however, regardless of competition or debate over
the subject in the immediate time, they will gain use. A good and useful idea,
that benefits both the development and understanding of ideas, tends to have
a lot of inertia with each passing generation it touches, which brings me to
a subject a little closer to home; the loom on which you read this.

The first device that resembled the idea of an automated computing machine was
the Jacquard loom, invented in 1801 by Joseph Marie Jacquard. It is the origin
of a lot of strange and gorgeous ideas which get mentioned in the emaciated
history portions of Computer Science lectures, including punch-cards. Each punched
hole on the card corresponded with a 'Bolus hook', the hooks will raise or lower
the harness of the loom, separating the warp and allowing the weft of the weaving
to lie above or below that warp in simple or complex patterns. Punch-cards themselves
were not original; they were an improvement on the punch-bands concept that
came before it.

These cards later went on into the work of Charles Babbage, after washing out
in his work with the Difference Engine. He was a collaborative fellow, interested
more in the results, the ideas, and the long-term. Amongst so many others, his
interactions crossed his path with that of a young, brilliant mathematician
known for her so-described scandalous behaviour and endlessly-sharp mind;
Ada Lovelace. In the 1830's and 1840's, his focused turned to a project which
he considered of utmost importance; it could perform arithmetic logic, control
the flow of logic through conditional branching and looping, and it had registers
in which to store information, like memory. He called it the Analytical Engine.

Unlike calculus, no one understood the Analytical Engine; it took many years,
and many responses from around Europe, and even then, it wasn't until after
Babbage's death and continuous tinkering on the Analytical Engine, that the
punch-card computer became reality. All the abstractions, and obstructions, of
industrial weaving and mathematics, packed into one idea that we now attribute
to be the first idea of a modern automated computer: he knew there was no way
he could do it himself.

His invention, just an idea, a sketch, truly gained value and acceptance, though,
not after he began developing and tinkering on the enormous punch-card loom,
but when Luigi Menabra described the engine in French, and his works were later
translated by Ada Lovelace, with additional notes. In those notes, she clearly
defines a means to calculate the Bernoulli numbers with the machine. Each party
involved believed whole-heartedly in this idea, in the Analytical Engine; not
one of them brought it to the public eye, but rather all three have their hands
in its importance: Babbage designed the original machine, Menabrea shared the
idea with the wider world, and Lovelace showed the world how they could use this
great invention.

The Bernoulli family was a strong supporter of Newton, just 150 years earlier.

## The Magic of Information

When people have access to information, a few will go out of their way to do
anything they can, for that information. Their intentions may be selfish and
surrounded by demands of reputation and claims of dispute, but their inventions
mix with the general conscious. Both of these concepts can be found in the every
day of modern human life. And these concepts can be found, having been designed
and implemented completely differently but accomplishing the same results, all
throughout the species. Without calculus, the demand for a Difference Engine,
and later Analytical Engine, would likely have been greatly reduced. Such maths
were the mystical methods of Babbage's "Enchantress of Numbers", Ada Lovelace,
and gave her the grounds and understanding to take the brilliant idea that was
the Analytical Engine, and explain it to the world with a simple number-generator.

There's some discussion, in the schools of sociology and anthropology, over what's
called the Hundredth Monkey Theorem, closely related to the Tipping Point theorem.
In it, it describes the behaviours of Japanese macaques on an island off the coast.
An anthropologist spread sweet potatoes along the beach of this island, and observed:
while most of the macaques took to trying to wipe the starchy treat clean,
some mothers in the nests began dipping their potatoes in the waters to clean them
off. It was said, that after a certain 'tipping point' was reached, every chimp
was dipping its sweet potatoes in water to clean them off.

These theories are often used to describe small- and medium-sized samples and
populations in the species, and especially behaviour on the internet. The problem
is, it's not true.

## Isn't Magic at All

There is no magic, in the species, that allows us to know things that other people
know; it is simply the evolutionary nature of thought. There was not a magic point
in which the first nest of macaques was not dipping their potatoes one day, save
maybe one or two females, and then the next, ten are dipping, and then the following,
a thousand are dipping. Rather, it was the young in the nests that observed the
older members dipping their potatoes and enjoying them with greater ease, and repeating
the behaviour, and teaching the behaviour to their kids, that led to the (eventual)
island of potato-cleaning monkeys.

And likewise, there is no magic with any other information for our species. We looked
up at the heavens, and across our planet, and determined that there were distances
that needed to be measured, shapes that needed to be de-constructed, and measurements
that needed to be sequenced, after generation by generation looking up and asking
the same question: "I wonder what that all is, up there." The people of Kerala, India,
found it remarkably unmagical to use concepts later defined as limits, differentiation,
and integration in hopes of measuring the movements of extremely-distant objects.

Herman Hollerith was a German immigrant's son in New York, in 1880, when he began
designing a machine with a very specific purpose; with the very ideas and writings
of Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace, as well as the thousands who, after Lovelace's
publishings found new light and began an international discourse on the application
of automated computers, constructed a machine that tabulated census data and
stored the information on punch-cards as removable memory; he would later go
on to form the company, International Business Machines. With each generation,
the ideas refined further and further; the younger watched the older with awe,
and a little bit of skepticism, and as much investment as they could offer --
and with more love for the idea than themselves, they carried us into a new era.
People would then begin discussing how to make computers talk to each other,
how to apply them militaristically, how to program them more efficiently, and,
150 years later, again, we stare at string-less looms that fit in our pockets
and in our purses, performing calculations and algorithmic interpretations of
data (otherwise known as 'searching') like none of these mentioned could have
imagined, at their place in the history of information.

## Gather, Curate, Share

Information should be for everyone. What they do with it is their own prerogative;
I suspect, though, that  the prerogative of a large percentage of the world's
population is survival and hope. I hope with them. I believe that information
should be gathered, curated, and shared with everyone, and I do mean everyone.
For it to be in one language, or only on the digital platforms, would make no
sense. If digital information is available to you, you should reach out and make
the best use of this information you can; I know I will. In the process, though,
I want to translate it, and I want to print it, and I want to distribute it.
Not everyone uses computers; not everyone speaks my language. But everyone can
benefit from the information that flows freely, whether legally or illegally,
across the internet; with dedication, focus, and different perspectives to debate
and discuss the subjects, anyone could be capable of anything, regardless of
language, education, birth-place, culture, economic status or social status.

All we need is the information, and the tools. I'll start with the information.
