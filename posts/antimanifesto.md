For months, now, most of my time has been spent thinking on a subject I thought
would just come naturally to me; "Why do I want to do these things? And how
does that relate to how I do these things?" My methods for answering these
questions hasn't been the best, I'll admit; Nine months of meditation and
Descartean self-exploration and self-definition, followed by freedom, and
structure and pattern, constant writing (even if I don't keep it), googling,
watching videos on TED.com and YouTube... And it's that same exploration, that
led me to meditation, that led me to question everything and my very self, and
now fills me with this drive and intensity. I want to write articles, and
essays, and software, and I want to design beautiful and sensible and
interoperable platforms for information, because I believe in gathering,
curating, and sharing information.

I love everyone; in fact, I believe in loving everyone. I believe in loving
everyone, because despite any difference or problem any person A can have with
any other person B, both A and B are humans, and you and I, the observers, are
also human. We share a species; for twenty-thousand years we have cultivated
not only agriculture, language, and civilization, but also concepts so powerful
and abstract: mathematics and industry, physics, astronomy, computers and the
internet, and diplomacy, just to name a few. Through co-operation and
conflict, interaction and quiet observation; through every human behaviour, we
have arrived, here, together.

## Good artists borrow, and great artists steal, but...

We have arrived, here, in a disjointed and unbalanced state. Simple access to
information may be taken for granted, where this is currently being read, but
there are places all over our world, where information is censored,
misrepresented, or just completely inaccessible. There are economic and
language barriers, and regions of the world where modern telecommunications
grids aren't feasible due to monsoon seasons or the proliferation of
copper-thieves, and there are also grand disagreements on the very history we,
as a species, share. What we do have in this age, though, that wasn't nearly as
feasible in previous ages, is the rapid collection, curation, translation, and
parallel digital and print distribution of any information we could wish, aided
by internet communication, satellites, and modern shipping systems.

It is said, regarding the Internet and citizen participation in the public
discourse, that 90% of people merely observe or consume the information
available, 9% curate or update or discuss the information, and only 1% of those
populations create the content, and keep the discourse moving through activity
and encouragement. Doing any of the above is easier than ever, for those of us
with Internet access; Wikipedia and Git, blogs and Twitter and Facebook and
App.net are the beginnings of globally-accessible information. Multiple authors
can discuss and debate on the writing of an article to later be published,
using Wikipedia's Talk pages, or GitHub's issues and comments;
nigh-immediately, a contributor can make their changes and save them safely
(without losing the previous version) to discuss the difference and compare.
With creativity, and intent, anyone can create specially-crafted Twitter search
terms, and plug them into IFTTT.com to have those tweets sent to your mobile
phone, or e-mailed to you in batch, so you can follow a story you wish to
curate into shape; and you can give your product the most stern of reviews --
Put your link on an appropriate page on Wikipedia; and you could even find
people to assist in translating your link so that the link can be put on all
the translations of the page in Wikipedia... But you can't share this
information where it is, arguably, needed most.

I believe that all life is art. I believe that good artists borrow, great
artists steal, and the best artists remix and collaborate. With a mind for
community, remixes, and collaboration, I wish to do all three parts, in the
diaspora of information: be a consumer, that pushes forward to create; be a
creator, who attends to the needs of curation and distribution; and be a
curator, who seeks out in and interesting consumption, discourse, and debate.
With the information collected, I wish to make this information available to
the places I suspect it will be of the best use; blueprints of architectural
and civil engineering and housing plans, the designs and considerations for
tools, white sheets detailing supplies, techniques, specific tools, concerns
and outright warnings associated with the end-result -- and everything between
here and there -- availed to students, and so-called "third-world" and
"developing" nations, and to those where internet access is still a distant
concept, if even known at all.

This isn't because I think any one of us have done it right. It would be
premature of me, at this point, to declare what is still actively happening
with such a polarizing concept such as "right" or "wrong". It is what is
generally accepted, by English-speaking nations, however; we accept these
things as such because of our thoughts, and our families, and our culture, and
our histories and ancestries. Whether the ideas are right or wrong, however,
many of them can be found in every culture and nationality, in some shape or
form; and it was by their own thoughts, their own families and cultures, their
own histories and ancestries that they were able to reach their own
conclusions, that somewhat matched ours. It is because we are, as a species,
capable of making discoveries under the most amazing of circumstances, and
oftentimes in parallel with other cultures or nations, without any awareness of
the other group of people working on the exact same idea.

## Fluxions and Differentials...

In the year AD 1699, there was a great debate that would influence the future
of a rather important, and increasingly-accepted, idea: did Gottfried Liebnitz
discover calculus, completely independently of Isaac Newton?

More than two decades of debate and discourse, mostly documented through the
personal letters sent by each to third-parties, went into this discussion.
Their ideas were almost identical; the difference came down to the means
through which they made their calculations, discoveries, and conclusions, and
the definition of relationships infinitesimal calculus: Liebnitz designated the
more familiar notation, and the term 'differential', while Newton provided the
'dot-notation', and called his infinitesimal units, 'fluxions'. Liebnitz
started with integration and made his way toward differentiation, while Newton
started with differentiation and made his way toward integration.

He must have copied it, he must have seen Newton's documents before 1675; this
was the most common detracting argument against Liebnitz in his defense of his
calculus. L'Hopital, whose works are amongst those that construct modern
calculus, accounted for both parties in his works describing infinitesimal
calculus; to this day, we use most of Newton's calculus, with Liebnitz' notation
and name for 'differentials'.

## .. And the Kerala School of Astronomy and Mathematics

But neither of them were first.

In the state of Kerala, India, with its oceans and mountains so convenient,
brilliant mathematicians and astronomers gathered to solve the great
astronomical problems of their day (between the 14th and 16th centuries AD).
Amongst their greatest discoveries is series-expansion for trigonometric
functions.

Two centuries before Liebnitz and Newton's famed debate over the inventor of
calculus, Indian mathematicians made discoveries based on the very ideas of
calculus, and without any formal descriptions of integration or
differentiation.  It is also documented, in the earliest English translations
of the works, that they used the 'intuitive concept of a limit', centuries
before their publication by L'Hopital.

## The Loom and the Computer

Once things are discovered, however, regardless of competition or debate over
the subject in the immediate time, they will gain use, if they are a good and
useful idea. These good and useful ideas, those that benefit both the
ease-of-use and understandability of concepts and improve on existing patterns
or needs, tend to have a lot of inertia with each passing generation of the
species it touches, which brings me to a subject a little closer to home: the
loom on which you read this.

The first device that resembled the idea of an automated computing machine was
the Jacquard loom, invented in 1801 by Joseph Marie Jacquard. It is the origin
of one of the stranger portions of the history of computing: the punch-card.
On these punch-cards, each punched hole corresponded with a Bolus hook (the
hook that will raise or lower the harness of the loom) separating the warp and
allowing the weft of the weaving to lie above or below the warp, in simple or
complex patterns. The punch-cards were an improvement on a previous idea, the
punch-band.

These cards later caught the attention of a very invested and dedicated
individual, by the name of Charles Babbage. After washing out in his decades of
work on the Difference Engine, and through much thought and collaboration, he
used the principles of Jacquard's loom and punch cards to design a
specification for a new engine; one that could perform arithmetic logic,
control the flow of logic through conditional branches and loops, and store
information in registers of memory. He called this device, the Analytical
Engine.

Unlike calculus, though, no one seemed to understand the Analytical Engine, in
its time; it took decades, and many responses from great minds in Europe and
England, before the Analytical Engine became anything more than what we would
now call a buggy, failed piece of vapourware. It truly gained acceptance, not
after he began developing and tinkering on his punch-card loom, but rather when
multiple contributors began discussing just how powerful such a device could
be.

When Babbage began the Analytical Engine in 1833, he was already
well-acquainted with a young, beautiful young woman of 17, known for her
so-called scandalous behaviour and endlessly-sharp mind; he called her the
"Enchantress of Numbers", Ada Byron, Countess of Lovelace. They remained in
steady contact over that decade; her dedication to the idea of the Analytical
Engine was unquestionably deep. But a decade later, with no one so much as
capable of figuring out what it does, let alone how it does it, the Enchantress
of Numbers translated a lonely article, written in French by Luigi Menabrea,
and began writing her own notes about the Engine. In these notes, she
describes, for the first time, a set of instructions which could be used, to
tell the Analytical Engine to print the Bernoulli numbers.

Babbage's idea was just a sketch. An idea and a lot of writing. Ada Byron was
an idealistic child who grew into a very intelligent woman, and believed in
this idea, as did Luigi Menabrea. It wasn't any single one of them that brought
the idea of an automated computing machine to the public eye; but rather, all
three have their hands in its importance: Babbage designed the machine and
defined its needs, Menabrea shared the idea with a much larger audience and
another language, and Ada Byron showed the world how they could use this
invention. To this day, because of her implementation of the Bernoulli numbers
instructions for the Analytical Engine, she is considered the first computer
programmer.

And the Bernoulli family was a strong supporter of Newton, just 150 years
earlier.

## The Magic of Information

When people have access to information, a few will go out of their way to do
anything they can, to have that information, to use that information, and
possibly to share that information. Their intentions may be selfish and
surrounded by demands of reputation or claims of dispute, but their inventions
and discoveries eventually mix with the general consciousness. This is seen in
the every day of human life; whether it be the use of multi-touch on your phone
or asking Google for an answer, or by using the sun to determine the time of
day or asking yourself, "I wonder what those lights in the sky are?" Without
calculus, the demand for a Difference Engine and later an Analytical engine
would have been reduced at that point in time. Such maths were the mystical
methods of the Enchantress of Numbers, Ada Byron of Lovelace, and they gave her
the grounds and understandings needed to be able to take the brilliant and
generally-misunderstood idea that was the Analytical Engine, and explain it to
the world in a way they could see it as of-value.

There's some discussion, in the schools of sociology and anthropology, over
what's called the Hundredth Monkey Theorem, closely related to the Tipping
Point theorem. In the Hundred Monkey theorem, the activities of Japanese
macaques on an island off the coast of Japan were studied and observed. An
anthropologist began spreading sweet potatoes in the sand of the beach of the
island; while most of the macaques would merely brush the sand off the surface
and eat their starchy treat, some mothers began dipping their sweet potatoes in
water before eating them, to get the sand off. It was said, that after a
certain critical mass was reached, every chimp on the island was dipping its
sweet potatoes in water to clean them off.

These theories are often used to describe small- and medium-sized samples and
populations that expect growth, especially regarding the Internet. The problem
is, it's not true.

## It Isn't Magic at All

There is no magic, in the species, that allows us to know things that other
people know; it's simply the evolutionary nature of thought. There was no magic
tipping point, at which macaques who had never seen the first nests of
potato-dippers, began dipping their potatoes independently; rather, it was the
young in the nests observing their mothers and aunts having a far easier time
eating their sweet potatoes, after dipping them, rather than wiping them. Then,
when one macaque would travel to another nest, either by ostracization or
independent exploration, it would bring with it the habit, and the pattern
would begin again elsewhere.  Knowledge is like a virus; you can't always track
every transmission of it, and it finds ways to get out.

There is no magic with any other information with our species, either. We
looked up at the heavens, and across our planet, and determined that there were
distances that needed to be measured, shapes that needed to be defined and
deconstructed, and functions that re-occur over and over in the universe; and
after generation after generation looking up and asking the same question, and
listening to their previous generations, and spreading their knowledge, because
every one of us wants to know, "what are those beautiful lights, up there?"
Without ever consulting Europe, the mathematicians and astronomers of Kerala,
India, used these remarkably unmagical concepts, later defined as limits,
integration, and differentiation, in hopes of measuring heaven; two hundred
years later, they were only proven right.

Herman Hollerith was a German immigrant's son in New York, in 1880, when he
began designing a machine with a very specific purpose; with the very ideas and
writings of Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace, as well as the thousands who,
after Lovelace's publishings found new light and began an international
discourse on the application of automated computers, constructed a machine that
tabulated census data and stored the information on punch-cards as removable
memory; he would later go on to form the company, International Business
Machines. With each generation, the ideas refined further and further; the
younger watched the older with awe, and a little bit of skepticism, and as much
investment as they could offer -- and with more love for the idea than
themselves, they carried us into a new era.  People would then begin discussing
how to make computers talk to each other, how to apply them militarily,
how to program them more efficiently, and, 150 years later, again, we stare at
string-less looms that fit in our pockets and in our purses, performing
calculations and algorithmic interpretations of data (otherwise known as
'searching') like none of these mentioned could have imagined, at their place
in the history of information.

## Gather, Curate, Share

It may seem arrogant of me, to talk of the needs of places in the world where
the necessity for clean water supercedes the necessity for, perhaps, education,
however, I am not trying to supercede anything. I am merely attempting to
collect, refine, and distribute. I can't possibly begin to tell these people
anything about living; those who survive the yearly hells of Bangladesh, those
who stare doubtful at the endless 'helpers' who provide no help in Africa,
those who defend their farms and their cultures, not as acts of terrorism but
mostly out of fear, in Southwest Asia -- the only thing I could do for them,
is create the opportunity to adapt new information; they have their ways of
doing things, and if they see how others have done things, maybe, just maybe...
They'll figure it out their way, and it'll be better than our way. It'll be
nearly impossible to do myself but, given no other choice, I would.

It is more important to me, that everyone have easy access to whatever
information they need to accomplish their own goals, and be treated fairly and
with respect for the merit of their thoughts and implementations, than it is
for me to be happy.

Information should be for everyone; absolutely everyone. What is done with the
information is their own prerogative; I suspect, though, that the prerogatives
of a large percentage of humans, are survival and hope. I hope with them.

I believe that information should be gathered, curated, and shared with
everyone.  For it to be in one language, or only on a digital platform, would
make no sense; but if digital is available to you, I'd love to ask your help in
this endeavour.  If you can translate documents or audio files or videos,
translate. If you can print copies of information for people without internet,
or produce audio tracks for the illiterate to help them figure out what they
are trying to solve, their way, then publish and produce. Not everyone uses
computers, not everyone speaks the same language, and not everyone is perfectly
literate; but, everyone can benefit from the information that flows freely
across the internet. With dedication, focus, and different perspectives to
debate and discuss the subjects, anyone could be capable of anything --
regardless of language, education, birth-place, culture, economic status, or
social status.

All we need is information, and tools. I'll start with the information.
