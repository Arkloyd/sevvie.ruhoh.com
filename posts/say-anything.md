Black and white are fine but god forbid Chinese;  
The mormons are finding the mainstream and to hell with scientology,  
Girls can be anything but still answer the phones diligently:  
We've come so far but where could we be?

The self is found in torrents of downloaded discography,  
We can say anything we want, so long as we don't say tragedy;  
Every person can share with you salvation and self-discovery,  
We've come so far, but really, who are we?

And in the silence, the sunshine, the relaxing social sea,  
You can speak of your God or you can slur with profanity,  
And when you think you're alone, strangers will change your calamity;  
We've come so far, but there's always more to see.

There's no more logic in calling them coloured or minority,  
There's no reason to think a man or woman could be lower than thee;  
There is no more class, just what we relate in old memories,

We've come so far, and it's time that we  
re-evaluated the concepts of caste and society  
To free ourselves of argument over piety  
To live by notoriety  
To open a discourse in the fiery  
Streets where your ire is felt most dire.  
Poor, rich, male, female, enslaved by anything or truly free;  
We've come so far; come farther with me.

Say Anything; if not for you, then for me.
